## 🔧 My Data Engineering Process

### 🏗️ Architecture

Implemented **Bronze → Silver → Gold layers** using Snowflake and ADF:

1. **Bronze:** Raw TSV ingestion into Snowflake  
2. **Silver:** Cleaning, flattening, and normalization in Alteryx  
3. **Gold:** Dimensional star schema for analytics and BI

---

### 🧹 Key Cleaning & Transformations

- Replaced all `\N` nulls with `"Unknown"` or `0`  
- Split multi-value fields (genres, known titles) into rows  
- Trimmed whitespace, standardized types (e.g. ratings as float)  
- Mapped ISO country and language codes for localization analysis  
- Built normalized genre, job, and character tables for seamless joins

---

## 🗃️ Star Schema Design

✅ Fact and dimension tables created for efficient querying:

- **Dimensions:** DIM_TITLE, DIM_GENRE, DIM_PERSON, DIM_REGION, DIM_LANGUAGE  
- **Facts:** FACT_RATING, FACT_EPISODE, FACT_JOB, FACT_CHARACTER
